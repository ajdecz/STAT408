  2. Mathematics using correlation coefficients, summary statistics, and sums of squares from ANOVA
  3. Two questions about using R output to answer questions 

Key Topics: 

  Simple Linear Regression 
    - interpret estimates of the population intercept and slope 
    - calculate and interpret confidence intervals for the parameter estimates
      (will give quantiles that will be useful)
    - perform hypothesis tests for simple linear regression
    - calculate and interpret confidence and prediction intervals for point 
      estimates given X. Like the questions where you need to find a reasonable 
      range using those formulas. Will give us variances and plug into an equation. 
      MLR do not need to know how to do linear algebra by hand 
    - know the relationships between t and f distributions
    - check if the assumptions of normality is violated. Knowing which output or 
      which test goes with which to check. 
  
  ANOVA
    - Calculate F statistics and mean squares from an ANOVA table. Do not worry 
      about p values 
    - Calculate and interpret r squared values using an ANOVA table 
    
  Multiple Linear Regression
    - Interpret estimates of parameters from the least squares regression line, for 
      both numeric and categorical explanatory variables.
    - Calculate and interpret confidence intervals for these parameters. 
    - Perform formal overall and partial f tests for statistical significance.
    - Calculate and interpret confidence and predition intervals using a given mean 
      squared error and variance of the prediction. 
    - Checking if assumptions are violated 
    
  Influential Observations 
    - do not need MLE, just know diff btwn estimates of variances are between 
      maximum likelihood and least squares
    - Differences between hat values, standardized residuals, and studentized
      residuals 
    - Know how to determine an observation is influential using the above values 
    - Know how to determine if an observation is influential using Cook's distance. 
      Don't need to know how to calculate, just how we use it to determine if 
      something is influential 
    
  Confounding and Interactions
    - determine if there potentially is an issue with multicollinearity 
    - what could happen to the model if there is an issue with multicollinearity 
    - how to interpret models that include interaction terms. 
    - how to conduct hypothesis tests for models with interaction terms 
    - how to check assumptions
  
  Transformation and Polynomial
    - know when to properly apply different transformations based on how the 
      assumptions are violated 
    - know how to apply the bullet points from multiple linear regression to 
      transform models
        - calculating confidence intervals
        - performing hypothesis tests 
        - checking assumptions 
    - same thing for adding polynomial terms 
  
  Variable selection
    - know why it is important to add multiple terms to your maximum model
    - Know how to identify the best model based on different selection criterion
      - adjusted rsquared, AIC, and Mallow's CP (don't need to know they work). 
        Based on the results how do we determine which is the best. Will give models 
        with all those statistics and have to identify which is the best model based on 
        the results. Choose which is the best option, the values are independent per 
        question. 
    - Check assumptions 
  
  Weighted Least Squares
    - know when to use weighted least squares based on what assumptions are violated 
    - how to properly calculate the weights for least squares regression 
    - all of the below, same as multiple linear regression
      - calculate and interpret confidence intervals 
      - perform hypothesis tests 
      - check model assumptions 
    
  Generalized Linear Models / Logistic Regression
    - don't need to know the theory or differences between families or how to check 
    - interpret logistic regression model parameter estimates and confidence intervals 
    - difference between wald and profile confidence intervals, and how to interpret 
      them, 
    - know how to perform a chi square test for significance of model 
    parameters 
    - know how to convert a log odds to a probability, and 
    vice versa 
  
  General
    - based on an output know which deviances we need to calculate proper outputs 
    - if we haved a test statistic (t) and it follows a 
    distribution with df = v, then t^2 is F df1=1 and df2=v
